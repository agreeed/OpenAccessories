# OpenAccessories
## Custom Effects, Accessories visible to others!
This script adds custom effects, accessories that are visible to every person using that script as well!
Please note that the script may not work with games that have custom characters that are not R6 or R15. The minimal requirement for proper encoding is 6 parts exlcuding HumanoidRootPart (R6).

> [!WARNING]
> This script is detectable! If a game implements a check on _serverside_ that counters the replication method used by the script, you may be punished by the game! (if they implement such a response).
